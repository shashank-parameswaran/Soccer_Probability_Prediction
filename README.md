# Soccer Probability Prediction

In this project, machine learning algorithms are deployed to predict probabilities of the outcome of soccer matches. The dataset comes from a Kaggle competition called ‘Football Match Probability Prediction’ and it contains historical matches played by different soccer teams from all over the world. Specifically, the dataset contains information on the past 10 matches of each game for both the teams involved and the outcome of the current match is predicted based on this. The task is a multiclass classification problem where we need to predict if the home team wins, draws or loses the game. Different models have been used such as Logistic regression, Random Forests, XGBoost, LDA and Neural Nets. The best error rate was observed in the Logistic regression model (0.507).
